                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>The one-day workshop focuses on the problem of privacy-preserving machine learning in scenarios where sensitive datasets are distributed across multiple data owners. Such distributed scenarios occur quite often in practice, for example when different parties contribute different records to a dataset, or information about each record in the dataset is held by different data owners.</p>
                <p>Different communities have developed approaches to deal with this problem, including differential privacy-like techniques where noisy sketches are exchanged between the parties, homomorphic encryption where operations are performed on encrypted data, and tailored approaches using techniques from the field of secure multi-party computation. The workshop will serve as a forum to unify different perspectives on this problem, explore the relative merits of each approach, and investigate future lines of research.</p>
                <p>The workshop will have a particular emphasis in the decentralization aspect of privacy-preserving machine learning. This includes a large number of realistic scenarios where the classical setup of differential privacy with a 'trusted curator' that prepares the data cannot be directly applied. The problem of privacy-preserving computation gains relevance in this model, and effectively leveraging the tools developed by the cryptographic community to develop private multi-party learning algorithms poses a remarkable challenge.</p>

                                <div class="accordion-body collapse talk-abstract" id="tabs4">Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) allows an interested party to evaluate a function over private data without learning anything about the inputs other than the outcome of this computation. This offers a strong privacy guarantee: SFE enables, e.g., a medical researcher, a statistician, or a data analyst, to conduct a study over private, sensitive data, without jeopardizing the privacy of the study's participants (patients, online users, etc.). Nevertheless, applying SFE to “big data” poses several challenges. First, beyond any computational overheads due to encryptions and decryptions, executing an algorithm securely may lead to a polynomial blowup in the total work (i.e., number of computation steps) compared to execution in the clear. For large datasets, even going from linear to quadratic time is prohibitive. Second, secure evaluations of algorithms should also maintain parallelizability: an algorithm that is easy to parallelize in the clear should also maintain this property in its SFE version, if its execution is to scale. Addressing this is challenging as communication patterns between processors often reveal a lot about the private inputs. In this talk, we show that several machine learning and data mining algorithms can be executed securely while leading to only (a) a logarithmic blow-up in total work and (b) a logarithmic increase in the execution time when executed in parallel. Our techniques generalize to any algorithm that is graph-parallel, i.e.,  can be expressed through a sequence of scatter, gather, and apply operations. This includes several algorithms of great practical interest, including page rank, matrix factorization, and training neural networks, to name a few.</div>

            <div id="abs1" class="panel-footer panel-paper-footer collapse">We study the problem of multi-party computation under approximate (ε, δ) differential privacy. We assume an interactive setting with k parties, each possessing a private bit. Each party wants to compute a function defined on all the parties’ bits. Differential privacy ensures that there remains uncertainty in any party’s bit even when given the transcript of interactions and all the other parties’ bits. This paper is a follow up to our work in [9], where we studied multi-party computation under (ε, 0) differential privacy. We generalize the results in [9] and prove that a simple non-interactive randomized response mechanism is optimal. Our optimality result holds for all privacy levels (all values of ε and δ), heterogenous privacy levels across parties, all types of functions to be computed, all types of cost metrics, and both average and worst-case (over the inputs) measures of accuracy.</div>

The iterative nature of stochastic variational inference presents challenges: multiple iterations are required to obtain accurate posterior distributions, yet each iteration increases the amount of noise that must be added to achieve a reasonable degree of privacy. We propose a practical algorithm that overcomes this challenge by combining: (1) A relaxed notion of the differential privacy, called concentrated differential privacy, which provides high probability bounds for cumulative privacy loss, which is well suited for iterative algorithms, rather than focusing on single-query loss; and (2) privacy amplification resulting from subsampling of large-scale data. Focusing on conjugate exponential family models, in our private variational inference, all the posterior distributions will be privatised by simply perturbing expected sufficient statistics. Using Wikipedia data, we illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for large-scale data.</div>

For the latter we show that using inducing inputs allows us to reduce the noise scale. For the datasets used, the two strategies have comparable accuracy. Together these methods provide a starter toolkit for combining differential privacy and Gaussian processes.</div>

Legal, ethical and societal issues restrict the sharing of sensitive data making it difficult to learn from datasets that are partitioned between many parties. The differential privacy framework guarantees preserving anonymity in a large dataset. However, in the distributed setting very few approaches exist for private data sharing. To this end, we propose PriDE, a scalable framework for distributed estimation where each party communicates perturbed sketches of their locally held features ensuring differentially private data sharing. For L2 penalized supervised learning problems PriDE has bounded estimation error compared with the optimal estimates obtained without privacy constraints in the non-distributed setting. </div>

Unlike the classical asymmetric curator/analyst scenario, here, each data site is both a data provider and a data consumer. The sites want to maximize the utility of the released data while providing privacy guarantees for participating individuals. A natural statistical model for this distributed scenario is coupled tensor factorization. We use a novel connection between differential privacy and sampling from a Bayesian posterior via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to derive an efficient and privacy preserving coupled tensor factorization algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed method is able to provide good prediction accuracy on synthetic and real datasets while providing both site-level and user-level differential privacy.</div>

We focus on a scenario in which a single company wishes to obtain the distribution of aggregate features, while ensuring a high level of privacy for the users. We are interested in the case where users own devices that are not necessarily powerful or online at all times, like smartphones or web browsers. This premise makes general solutions, such as general multiparty computation (MPC), less applicable. We design an efficient special-purpose MPC protocol that outputs aggregate features to the company, while keeping online presence and computational complexity on the users' side at a minimum. This basic protocol is secure against a majority of corrupt users, as long as they do not collude with the company. If they do, we still guarantee security, as long as the fraction of corrupt users is lower than a certain, tweakable, parameter. We propose different enhancements of this solution: one guaranteeing some degree of active security, and one that additionally ensures differential privacy (DP). Finally, we report on the performance of our implementation of the above solutions. </div>

            <div id="abs8" class="panel-footer panel-paper-footer collapse">Secure Aggregation is a class of Secure Multi-Party Computation algorithms wherein a group of mutually distrustful parties u ∈ U each hold a private value x_u and collaborate to compute an aggregate value, such as the sum P = SUM(x_u, u∈U), without revealing to one another any information about their private value except what is learnable from the aggregate value itself. In this work, we consider training a deep neural network in the Federated Learning model, using distributed gradient descent across user-held training data on mobile devices, using Secure Aggregation to protect the privacy of each user’s model gradient. We identify a combination of efficiency and robustness requirements which, to the best of our knowledge, are unmet by existing algorithms in the literature. We proceed to design a novel, communication-efficient Secure Aggregation protocol for high-dimensional data that tolerates up to 1/3 of users failing to complete the protocol. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offers 1.73× communication expansion for 2^10 users and 2^20-dimensional vectors, and 1.98× expansion for 2^14 users and 2^24-dimensional vectors.</div>

The privacy guarantees are due to the use of Rademacher observations (rados) for learning, where these rados are calculated using only the functionality provided by {\it partially} homomorphic encryption, which obscures the source data and provides realistic learning times. Furthermore, differentially private Rados may be calculated, leading to a distributed machine learning algorithm where all data remains private to the contributors, and the resulting learnt model cannot be used to reconstruct any of the data. Finally, we demonstrate that these models can be learnt when the datasets only share some categorical features, and the correspondences between entities in the datasets are {\it not} known.

For this type of networks, the main issue is to gather/learn global information on the network (e.g., by optimizing a global cost function) while keeping the (sensitive) information at each node. In this work, we focus on text information that agents do not want to share (e.g., text messages, emails, confidential reports). We use recent advances on decentralized optimization and topic models to infer topics from a graph with limited communication. We propose a method to adapt latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to decentralized optimization and show on synthetic data that we still recover similar parameters and similar performance at each node than with stochastic methods accessing to the whole information in the graph.</div>

            </div>
            <div id="abs12" class="panel-footer panel-paper-footer collapse">Machine learning relies on the availability of high-quality training data and---whether by its inherent nature, or by accident---this data will sometimes contain private information. When the model is to be published or made publicly accessible and the training data is not, it is important that the details of the sensitive training data cannot be inadvertently revealed by the model. This abstract presents a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for machine learning training data. The approach is based on combining, in a black-box fashion, multiple machine learning models trained with disjoint sensitive datasets, such as data for different users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are used only as ``teachers'' for a ``student'' machine learning model. However, when training the student, the teachers transfer only the labels upon which they all generally agree, via a noisy aggregation mechanism. The student has privacy properties that can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy. These properties address ``glass-box'' attacks of the kind that arise if an adversary not only queries the student but also inspects its internal workings. The approach imposes only weak assumptions on how the teachers are trained. It applies to powerful, deep models, possibly with many layers and parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach applies to real-world machine learning tasks, at a reasonable cost in accuracy, privacy, and software complexity.</div>

A large sample size will improve the performance of the learned models. On the other hand, data is often distributed privately to each site due to privacy reasons. Data anonymization is often used for privacy preservation in data sharing. However, anonymization decreases data utility while the privacy remains at risk. As an alternative approach for learning models from distributed private data, we focus on ensemble learning techniques. By using ensemble learning techniques, we can obtain a learned model based on all data by sharing only learned models from local sites.We compared privacy and utility of an anonymized data sharing and a learned model sharing. The utility is examined by the performance of the classifier made from shared anonymized datasets and that from shared classifiers. To examine privacy, we applied homogeneity attacks and model inversion. We evaluate privacy and utility using a real-world dataset and show that superiority of sharing learned models.</div>

Evaluation of a prototypical implementation on artificial training data shows that linear regression models with a million samples and 100 features can be computed securely in less than half an hour on commodity hardware. Additionally, for even larger input datasets, a tradeoff between accuracy and computation time is identified and discussed. By approximating the result using the presented custom implementation of the iterative Conjugate Gradient Descent algorithm, a significant speedup can be achieved at a moderate price in terms of accuracy.</div>

AnonML users store and compute features on their own data, thereby limiting the amount of information they need to share. To generate a model, a group of data-holding peers first agree on a model definition, a set of feature functions, and an aggregator, a peer who temporarily acts as a central authority. Each peer anonymously sends several small packets of labeled feature data to the aggregator. In exchange, the aggregator generates a classifier and shares it with the group. In this way, AnonML data holders control what information they share on a feature-by-feature and model-by-model basis, and peers are able to disassociate features from their digital identities. Additionally, each peer can generate models suited to their particular needs, and the whole network benefits from the creation of novel, useful models.</div>

The typical clients in this setting are mobile phones, and communication efficiency is of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs. The proposed methods are evaluated on the application of training a deep neural network to perform image classification.
